BODY/DOUBLE is a modern web application inspired by Omegle that helps users find accountability partners for work, study, or creative projects.
The platform allows users to connect with others who share similar goals, job titles, or classes and integrate focus sessions using the Pomodoro technique to stay productive together.

This project emphasizes responsive design, real-time collaboration concepts, and clean UI/UX principles.
